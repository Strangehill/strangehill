### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love it when User Experience matches Information Architecture matches Developer Experience.

I like it when the sounds match the motion pictures.

I like it when my partner and I take that first bite after spending a couple hours together improvising in the kitchen.

I want to work doing what I love and I want to grow.

There's so much I want to work on.

I want to motivate people to take community action to make our cities more livable and sustainable spaces.

I believe it takes storytelling, community building, data and design.

My experience is varied. I love making content and I want to to do it for larger audiences.

Let's publish. Let's collaborate. Let's get conversations going. Let's come together.

A thing I can point to with great pride is a website I've been working on, on and off.
It's [yidacnc.co](https://www.yidacnc.co), built with GatsbyJS (React), off a starter template but adding a custom i18n language-picking tool, and where I've experimented designing a work-in-progress customizer widget. I'd love to see

My goals for the short and medium term are:
- to master GatsbyJS and React, learn how to implement authentication and delve more formally into the back-end to develop feature-rich apps,
- to grow a community with my neighbors and friends in Taichung City, and beyond.

follow me on [Twitch/Strangehill](https://www.twitch.tv/strangehill), and add me on Discord (user: Strangehill#6812) so we can build something cool together.
